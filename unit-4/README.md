## Core Concepts

These are taken from the **Concepts and Objectives** and represent the material you should aim to cover in your standups during the unit's week. Since there are often bonus/level up objectives listed in Frodo, these are the items that seem realistic to teach and demo in the limited time we have for standups. 

 - MVP items...


 ## The Review Project

The easiest way to teach the core concepts each week is to build out a project that mirrors the unit project somewhat. Below are some examples of review projects, but feel free to implement your own. You should aim to build an MVP for your review project that is based on the core concepts, and remember that the standups should be flexible and pivot based on student questions and needs. 

It's extremely helpful for most students to see a component tree for each project. Before you create a component tree, you should make an MVP with 3-5 features that you can reference as you build the component tree.
